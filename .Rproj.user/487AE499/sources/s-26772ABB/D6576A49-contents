description: I have academic background in Statistics, completed between the universities of Bologna, Glasgow and Melbourne. Once in Melbourne, I joined the WEHI where I did her Masters research in Population Genetics followed by a PhD in Cancer Genomics, working on relapse in Leukemia. I then then worked for 1.5 years as a Data Scientist for the AI consulting company Eliiza and since June 2021 I have joined the Melbourne based startup Mass Dynamics as a Bioinformatics Data Scientist. Currently, I develop workflows for the analysis of mass spectrometry data, with the aim of making proteomics more accessible to more life scientists and supporting them in their discoveries.
