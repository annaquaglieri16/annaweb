The group, founded in 2016, is the first R Programming community for women and
supporters in Australia. I was the main organiser of the group in 2017/2018 where we organised 12
events (workshops, seminars and networking nights). During that period we also defined the
structure to become a not-for-profit association; provided funding for women to attend the
useR! conference; gained a new sponsor, Nous Group, and renewed sponsorship from CSL.

I summarized the R-Ladies achievement during that period in a blog post https://rladiesmelb2018.netlify.com/.
