[R-Ladies Melbourne](https://r-ladiesmelbourne.github.io/), founded in 2016, is Australia’s first R programming community dedicated to supporting women and allies in the field. As a founding committee member and President in 2017–2018, I contributed to the group’s growth and success until stepping down from organizing in 2023.
As I stepped down as President in 2018, I reflected on the achievements of that year in this blog post: R-Ladies Melbourne, when the group organized 12 impactful events, including workshops, seminars, and networking nights. Significant achievements from this period included establishing the structure to become a not-for-profit association, securing funding to support women attending the useR! conference, gaining a new sponsor, Nous Group, and renewing sponsorship from CSL. 

Since its founding, the group has hosted over 80 events and grown to more than 2,500 members (see [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/r-ladies-melbourne/) page), becoming a vibrant and thriving community. It fills me with immense pride and happiness to see the incredible women who continue to lead the group, organizing events and fostering inclusivity, ensuring its ongoing success eight years on.
