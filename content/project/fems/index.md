In June 2021, I joined Mass Dynamics and at the same time the field of Mass Spectrometry (MS), a completely new field for me. From the experience of being part of the R-Ladies Melbourne and Global community I realised how important it has been to be part of a community. Thereofe, I looked for a MS community and FeMS was there! 

I took part into their yearly mentoring program between December 2021 until June 2022. During that period i was assigned to a mentoring group, comprising of 2 mentors and a few mentees, all working in different areas of MS in the Australian and Asian time zones. We met monthly and each month we would discuss a different topic, from personal development, MS intruments and new techologies. I now feel way more part of the MS community and I have people that I can contact for suggestions and support!
