FeMs was founded in 2019 with the aim of empowering and bringing together underrepresented communities in the field of Mass Spectrometry.

In June 2021, I joined Mass Dynamics and stepped into the field of Mass Spectrometry (MS)—a completely new area for me. Having experienced firsthand the value of being part of a supportive community through R-Ladies Melbourne and the broader R-Ladies Global network, I knew how important it was to find a similar sense of belonging in the MS field. That’s when I discovered FeMS!

From December 2021 to June 2022, I participated in the FeMS annual mentoring program. I was placed in a mentoring group consisting of two mentors and several mentees, all working in different areas of MS across the Australian and Asian time zones. We met monthly to discuss a range of topics, including personal development, MS instruments, and emerging technologies.

This experience not only deepened my understanding of MS but also helped me feel more connected to the MS community. I now have a network of people I can turn to for advice, collaboration, and support—a connection that has been invaluable in my journey.
