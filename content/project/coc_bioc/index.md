Since December 2021, I have been a member of the [Bioconductor Code of Conduct (CoC)](https://www.bioconductor.org/about/code-of-conduct/#:~:text=We%20do%20not%20tolerate%20harassment,in%20online%20venues%2C%20including%20chats) Committee, initially serving as Secretary and later as Chair. The Bioconductor CoC is dedicated to fostering a welcoming and supportive environment, free from harassment, intimidation, and bullying. The committee is responsible for upholding these principles, addressing reports of misconduct at Bioconductor conferences (both online and in-person), and moderating interactions on online platforms, chats, forums, and other community spaces.

As Secretary (2021–2023), my responsibilities included organizing meeting schedules, coordinating with committee members, and maintaining accurate meeting minutes. In my role as Chair (2023–2024), I assumed leadership of the committee, overseeing meeting agendas, managing board conduct, and leading the response to several incident reports.
