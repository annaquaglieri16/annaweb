After the incredible experience of attending my first "Out Of The Shadows"" leadership workshop organized by FeMS in Melbourne, I was inspired to share my favorite moments, impactful quotes, and key takeaways from the day.

In the blog post [Coffees, conversations, and negotiations: an energizing day @ FeMS “Out Of The Shadows” Workshop](https://blog.massdynamics.com/mass-dynamics-blog/femsoutoftheshadowsblog), I’ve shared my favourite moments of the day. Take a look to learn more about the workshop and get motivated to join one of the upcoming cohorts!
