[Toastmasters](https://www.toastmasters.org/) is an international organization dedicated to helping individuals enhance their communication, public speaking, and leadership skills in a nurturing environment. It offers extensive mentoring and educational resources to support its members' growth.

I became a member of the [Parkville Toastmasters group](https://www.toastmasters.org/Find-a-Club/03672383-03672383) in 2019. Since joining, I have delivered over 15 speeches and honed my skills in organizing both online and in-person events. My involvement has extended to various volunteer roles within the organizing committee.

In my role as Vice President of Membership, I serve as the initial point of contact for prospective members, facilitating their membership process, providing essential information to get them started, and pairing them with mentors within the club. Through this group and the supportive community it fosters, I have significantly improved my presentation skills, learned to craft engaging speeches, and gained confidence in addressing diverse audiences.
