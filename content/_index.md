description: I am a Senior Bioinformatics Data Scientist @ Mass Dynamics in Melbourne with a background in Statistics and Bioinformatics. I can count of over 10 years of experience utilising statistics and software to makes sense of various types of â€˜omics data including population genetics, genomics, epigenetics and proteomics in both academia and industry. Currently, I work with software engineers, designers, marketing savvy and other scientists to make proteomics more accessible to more life scientists. As an expat, I love being part and support local communities. You can find more about it here!
