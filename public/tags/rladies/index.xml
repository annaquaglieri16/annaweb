      <description>&lt;p&gt;The group, founded in 2016, is the first R Programming community for women and
supporters in Australia. I was the main organiser of the group in 2017/2018 where we organised 12
events (workshops, seminars and networking nights). During that period we also defined the
structure to become a not-for-profit association; provided funding for women to attend the
useR! conference; gained a new sponsor, Nous Group, and renewed sponsorship from CSL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I summarized the R-Ladies achievement during that period in a blog post &lt;a href=&#34;https://rladiesmelb2018.netlify.com/&#34;&gt;https://rladiesmelb2018.netlify.com/&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I joined the group in 2019 and since then I&amp;rsquo;ve been learning so much about giving presentations and growing my confidence in front of an audience. The community at Toastmasters Parkville is extremely supportive and engaging making every event night super fun!&lt;/p&gt;
